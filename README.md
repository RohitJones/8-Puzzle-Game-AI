# 8-Puzzle-Game-AI

This is a basic 8-puzzle problem game that I created as part of my course work in the course Artificial Intelligence.
I have implemented 2 different algorithms, namely A* and Hill Climbing algorithm to solve this game.
The game itself was made using the PyGame framework for Python.
